# The development and evolution of inhibitory neurons in primate cerebrum
Resources from [The development and evolution of inhibitory neurons in primate cerebrum](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04510-w). Contains scripts for analysis, raw imaging manual cell counting data, and the comparative annotation toolkit GTF version of the RheMac10 annotation used for the study.


The raw reads (inhibtory neurons only) for the macaque data can be found in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE169122 (full brain dataset released by end 2022). Datasets can be browsed and count matrices can be accessed for the developing macaque, developing and combined mouse at https://dev-inhibitory-neurons.cells.ucsc.edu.
